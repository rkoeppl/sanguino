The Sanguino is an Arduino compatible microcontroller board based on the ATmega644P, the biggest and most powerful DIP atmega processor we could find.  We ported the Arduino core for use with the Arduino host software (after a painless installation process).  More recently we have added support for the ATmega1284P an even more powerful processor in some respects, while still being available in a DIP package!
